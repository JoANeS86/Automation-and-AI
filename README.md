### 1. What Prompt Engineering Actually Is

Prompt engineering is the art of making AI behave predictably and usefully by writing instructions that eliminate ambiguity.
It’s less “talking to AI” and more designing constraints, roles, formats, and thinking paths — like UX design + API design combined.

### 2. Core Principles

- Be explicit, not polite → AI doesn’t infer intent (unless forced). State role, goal, format, boundaries.
- Specify the output format → bullets? table? JSON? Demand it. Format is power.
- Give context the AI wouldn’t know → target audience, domain constraints, voice rules.
- Iterate like a feedback loop → first answer is draft, refine via meta-instruction.
- Think like system design, not conversation → you are engineering repeatable behavior.

### 3. Useful Patterns (Prompt Types)

These are reusable prompt architectures, not “magic phrases”:

### 4. Advanced Tricks

- Self-checking AI — “Before final answer, verify consistency with instructions.”
- Task decomposition — force AI to break work into steps (“think THEN answer”).
- Mental model injection — “Use 80/20 rule / first-principles / inversion to approach this.”
- Perspective switching — “Answer first as X. Now rewrite as if Y completely disagrees.”
- Hidden meta-goals — secretly optimize tone for persuasion, virality, risk avoidance, etc.

### 5. The Real Skill

It’s not “knowing magic prompts.”
It’s learning to spot ambiguity, enforce structure, and progressively engineer control over an alien but predictable reasoning engine.
The pros think in terms of systems, not single questions — they build repeatable power, not “hope it answers well.”
